**praxis** is an embeddable JavaScript engine in safe Rust, zero runtime dependencies, measured
against test262. You are building it one milestone at a time, and the measure of progress is a
conformance number, not a feeling of completeness.

## The shape of the work

This project is **long, not hard**. There is no breakthrough waiting; there are ~50,000 test262
tests, each of which either passes or does not. That has three consequences for how you work:

- **Never guess at the spec.** ECMA-262 is online and unambiguous. Every non-obvious behaviour
  gets a comment citing its section (`// ECMA-262 §13.15.2 — assignment evaluates the target
  reference BEFORE the value`). "I think JS does X" is how an engine acquires a bug that takes
  three months to find.
- **Prefer the boring implementation.** The clever one costs you at every conformance edge case.
  Optimize when a benchmark, not an intuition, says to — and prototype it in `lab/` first.
- **Land small.** One coherent slice per commit, green each time. A 3,000-line "parser
  done" commit cannot be reviewed, cannot be bisected, and cannot be probed meaningfully.

## Repository layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | The engine. Zero deps, no `unsafe`, no panics, fully tested. |
| `lab/` | Experiments — see [`lab/README.md`](lab/README.md). Not shipped, and cannot be imported by the engine. |
| `conformance/` | The test262 harness and its expectations ratchet (arrives at M5). |
| `decisions/` | Decision records for anything architectural: one file, prose + the invariant it implies. |
| `GOAL.md` | The charter. Binding. |

Planned module order inside `src/` — build in this order, because each genuinely needs the one
before it:

```
span.rs      source positions                          [DONE — the worked example of the bar]
lexer.rs     source -> tokens
ast.rs       the syntax tree
parser.rs    tokens -> AST  (ASI, early errors)
value.rs     the value representation
heap.rs      objects, properties, prototypes, GC
compile.rs   AST -> bytecode
vm.rs        the interpreter loop
builtins/    Object, Function, Array, String, Number, Math, JSON, Error, ...
api.rs       the embedding surface
```

## Milestones

Each milestone names its **oracle** — the objective thing that says "done". Work to the oracle,
not to your own sense of completeness.

**M1 — Lexer.** All ES2015 token forms: identifiers with Unicode escapes, all numeric literals
(legacy octal, `0b`/`0o`/`0x`, separators), strings with every escape, template literals with
nesting, regex-vs-division disambiguation, comments, all four line terminators, and the newline
flags ASI will need. *Oracle:* hand-written token tests per form, plus a round-trip property —
every token knows its span, and the spans of a token stream reconstruct the source exactly.

**M2 — Parser.** ES5 statements and expressions, functions, full operator precedence, ASI, and
the early errors the spec demands (assignment to a call, `delete x` in strict mode, duplicate
parameters, `break` outside a loop). Errors carry spans and read like a good compiler's.
*Oracle:* test262's `syntax` and `early` tests for the implemented grammar — these run before
you have a VM, which is why the parser is worth finishing properly first.

**M3 — Values, heap, and a VM that runs code.** Value representation (start with a plain enum —
NaN-boxing is an M8 experiment, and the lab decides it with a number), the object model with
prototypes and property attributes, a mark-sweep GC, bytecode compiler, interpreter loop.
Arithmetic and coercion (`ToNumber`, `ToString`, `ToPrimitive` — the abstract operations, spelled
out as such), control flow, functions, closures, `this`, `try`/`catch`/`finally`. *Oracle:* the
first real test262 run. Expect a low number; it is a starting line, not a grade.

**M4 — The ES5 library.** `Object`, `Function`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Math`,
`JSON`, `Date`, `RegExp` (our own backtracking engine — no dependency), the `Error` hierarchy.
Property descriptors, getters/setters, strict-mode semantics throughout. *Oracle:* ES5-tagged
test262 passing at 95%+.

**M5 — The conformance harness proper.** `conformance/` runs test262 in parallel, understands
its YAML frontmatter (`includes`, `flags: onlyStrict/noStrict/module/raw`, `negative`), and
maintains an **expectations file that may only shrink**. Wire it before M6 — from here on it is
the thing that tells you what to build next.

**M6 — ES2015 core.** `let`/`const` and the temporal dead zone, classes, arrow functions,
destructuring, spread/rest, template literals, `for...of`, iterators, generators, `Symbol`,
`Map`/`Set`/`WeakMap`/`WeakSet`, `Promise` and the job queue, `Proxy`/`Reflect`. This is the
largest milestone by far — split it, and let the conformance failure buckets choose the order.

**M7 — Modern syntax.** `async`/`await`, async iteration, optional chaining, nullish coalescing,
exponentiation, `BigInt`, modules with a host-provided resolver.

**M8 — Performance.** Only now: shapes/hidden classes, inline caches, interned strings,
NaN-boxing, a register VM. Every one of these is a lab experiment with a benchmark before it is
a commit, and none may cost a single conformance test.

## Workflow for one change

1. **Read the spec section.** Cite it in a comment. If you cannot find it, you do not yet know
   what you are implementing.
2. **Unsure of the design? Go to `lab/` first.** Prototype, measure, write the NOTES.md verdict,
   then implement in `src/` from scratch — never by copying the spike (`lab/README.md` rule 3).
3. **Write the code and its tests together.** A test that merely passes is worth little; it must
   *fail* when the logic is wrong. That is what mutation testing is about to check.
4. **Mutation testing** — zero survivors on the lines you touched. A survivor is a precise
   statement that a branch you wrote is untested, and it comes with the input that
   distinguishes it. Fix the test, not the branch.
5. **The gate** — green (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, `missing_docs`, no-unsafe, the boundary).
6. **Run the conformance suite** once M5 exists. The number goes up, or the change explains why.
7. **Commit.** The message says what changed *behaviourally*, not which files moved.

## House style

- Comments explain **why**, never what. The code says what.
- Doc comments on everything public (`missing_docs` is denied) — including what a function does
  when the input is nonsense.
- Errors are values with spans. No `unwrap()` in production paths; `expect("<invariant>")` only
  where a panic would mean an engine bug the types cannot encode.
- Tests are named as sentences about behaviour: `a_crlf_pair_ends_one_line_not_two`, not
  `test_line_col_2`. **`src/span.rs` is the worked example** — match its density of intent.

## Start here

The engine is at M0: `src/span.rs` exists and the lab is empty. **M1 (the
lexer) is the next thing to build.** Read `GOAL.md`, then `src/span.rs` to calibrate, then begin.
